[{"content":" Parametric Study of a Microwave Absorber Based on Metamaterials # this post is a work in progress # In the fall semester of academic year 2024-2025 I decided took upon a project in order to design a microwave absorber based on metamaterials. In this post I will document the progress as I learn and develop the cell and the modeling in order to lay everything publicly available and also to short of understand better as I try and explain the process to this figurative rubber ducky that is my editor, not the one it has because vs code pets is not very feature rich at the moment. Finally I have opened a GitHub repository for the report that I\u0026rsquo;ll eventually submit to my university and for based upon I\u0026rsquo;ll be credited, it can be found here.\nSo at first I start by designing a basic layout in CST..\nfor this I\u0026rsquo;ll implement a three-layer structure:\nA dielectric Substrate w/ a metal Resonance Layer An Air Layer A Metal Copper Back-Plate At first I\u0026rsquo;ll place the substrate without the resonance layer: Later I\u0026rsquo;ll place the metal resonance layer as well but there are a number of possible candidates I think of trying to simulate whereas the vertical layout is pretty much fixed.\nWithout further\u0026rsquo; ado I\u0026rsquo;ll place the two other layers below Z=0, turn on the orthographic side view to remove shadows and voila: I think it really gives a sense of scale as the air layer truly shadows the other two.\nNow its time to add the ring that is of the same material and thickness as the backplate and lies on top of the dielectric substrate. Then I will move the substrate, air and backplate layers all below Z=0 just ti make is easier with designing the arrows. For this I make the assumption that both the arrow body and point are \\(\\alpha = 0.5mm\\) of width. In order to accurately place all the curve points that define the arrow some basic calculations shall be made. The two points of the arrow base lie exactly on the arc of the ring and are equidistant from curve y=x so the in order to find their cartesian coordinates the following system shall be solved.\nsyms x1 x2 eq1 = 2*(x1 - x2)^2 == .5^2; eq2 = sqrt(x2^2 + x1^2) == 2.7; sol = solve([eq1, eq2], [x1 x2]); disp([sol.x1 sol.x2]); $$ \\displaystyle \\begin{array}{l} \\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \\sigma_3 -\\frac{2916,\\sigma_1 }{1433} \u0026amp; -\\sigma_1 \\newline \\sigma_4 -\\frac{2916,\\sigma_2 }{1433} \u0026amp; -\\sigma_2 \\newline \\frac{2916,\\sigma_1 }{1433}-\\sigma_3 \u0026amp; \\sigma_1 \\newline \\frac{2916,\\sigma_2 }{1433}-\\sigma_4 \u0026amp; \\sigma_2 \\end{array}\\right)\\newline\\newline \\textrm{where}\\newline \\sigma_1 =\\sqrt{\\frac{729}{200}-\\frac{7,\\sqrt{59}}{80}}\\newline \\sigma_2 =\\sqrt{\\frac{7,\\sqrt{59}}{80}+\\frac{729}{200}}\\newline \\sigma_3 =\\frac{400,{{\\left(\\frac{729}{200}-\\frac{7,\\sqrt{59}}{80}\\right)}}^{3/2} }{1433}\\newline \\sigma_4 =\\frac{400,{{\\left(\\frac{7,\\sqrt{59}}{80}+\\frac{729}{200}\\right)}}^{3/2} }{1433}\\end{array} $$\nWhich results in two points/quadrant so picking out the two points of the 1st quadrant and inserting them to CST the arrow body is parallel again Then the arrow is mirrored against the X, the Y and the XY planes in order to reach all four sides of the cell, then the face is covered with copper and a height of d=0.035mm is also attributed, which is why it was important to move all other layers below Z=0. Now I\u0026rsquo;ll try and perform a simulation using the frequency solver in CST just to get an idea how the component behaves, the boundaries will be periodic along the XY plate and I will add absorbing conditions along the Z axis.\nFor reference the mesh with only the ring element on the surface ends up such as: ","date":"2024 November 15","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/mmas/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"MMAs","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2023 November 21","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2023 November 20","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Homepage","summary":"","title":"Homepage","type":"page"},{"content":"This page contains the documentation of this site, how it\u0026rsquo;s inner parts work in orer to be deployed correctly\n","date":"2023 October 29","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/docs/","section":"MarksBlog","summary":"","title":"MarksBlog","type":"docs"},{"content":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\u003e α-β-γ filtersα-β-γ filtersTracking the constant velocity aircraft in one dimensionInitState Extrapolationvelocity supposedly stays constantBegin CyclesPlot ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/kalman/matlab/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
