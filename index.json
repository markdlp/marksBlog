[{"content":" Parametric Study of a Microwave Absorber Based on Metamaterials. # this post is pushed directly without preview as my windows pc cant handle docker along w/ every other program I ran for this all at once\nIn the fall semester of academic year 2024-2025 I decided took upon a project in order to design a microwave absorber based on metamaterials. In this post I will document the progress as I learn and develop the cell and the modeling in order to lay everything publicly available and also to short of understand better as I try and explain the process to this figurative rubber ducky that is my editor, not the one it has because vs code pets is not very feature rich at the moment. Finally I have opened a GitHub repository for the report that I\u0026rsquo;ll eventually submit to my university and for based upon I\u0026rsquo;ll be credited, it can be found here.\n","date":"2024 November 15","permalink":"/posts/mmas/","section":"Posts","summary":"Parametric Study of a Microwave Absorber Based on Metamaterials.","title":"MMAs"},{"content":"","date":"2023 November 21","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":"2023 November 20","permalink":"/","section":"Homepage","summary":"","title":"Homepage"},{"content":"This page contains the documentation of this site, how it\u0026rsquo;s inner parts work in orer to be deployed correctly\n","date":"2023 October 29","permalink":"/docs/","section":"MarksBlog","summary":"This page contains the documentation of this site, how it\u0026rsquo;s inner parts work in orer to be deployed correctly","title":"MarksBlog"},{"content":"","date":"0001 January 1","permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","date":"0001 January 1","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"0001 January 1","permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series"},{"content":"","date":"0001 January 1","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"}]
