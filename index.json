In greater detail customers in the retail food industry often struggle with reordering essentials efficiently, leading to missed purchases, stockouts at home, and irrelevant product recommendations. While subscription models exist, they lack true personalizationâ€”failing to consider individual shopping frequency, lifestyle preferences (health-conscious, budget-focused, premium), and real-time consumption patterns. In other words there is a need to Develop an AI-driven smart reordering system that predicts when customers need to replenish products based on purchase frequency, household size, consumption patterns, and lifestyle preferences (e.g., budget-conscious, healthy shopper, premium buyer). The system should generate intelligent suggested orders, which customers can approve, modify, or auto-purchase via an omni-channel experience (app, web, or in-store pickup).\nBreaking down the problem # At first in order for the product to be developed and shipped efficiently the correct development cycle must be chosen. For this I was thinking of choosing extreme programming as it aligns well with sensitive customer data and is also quite agile. Also it shall be an attempt to democratize this sector as most competitive products are only implemented internally for their customers and are very closed source.\nCreating Issues # To create the correct issues is to do brainstorming in a narrow manner. In greater detail the issues describe the user experience and provide guidelines for the user interface.\nAs a user I\nwant to see a basket with the products I order most commonly want to see suggestions of probable products I may need want to green light a recurring order with some basic necessities want to chat with an agent to add products to my basket for a specific recipe or a function want to set preferences like budget, calories etc. However it is also important to define an Administrator role to oversee the user-AI interaction. As an admin I\nneed to check for errors and prevent overflows need to track stagnant orders need to predict demand based on active orders modify supply chains based on price fluctuations while fulfilling customer needs. Getting more specific a UML Diagram can describe the interface and the interactions. sequenceDiagram Alice-\u003e\u003eJohn: Hello John, how are you? John--\u003e\u003eAlice: Great!
