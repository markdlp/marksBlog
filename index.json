In greater detail customers in the retail food industry often struggle with reordering essentials efficiently, leading to missed purchases, stockouts at home, and irrelevant product recommendations. While subscription models exist, they lack true personalizationâ€”failing to consider individual shopping frequency, lifestyle preferences (health-conscious, budget-focused, premium), and real-time consumption patterns. In other words there is a need to Develop an AI-driven smart reordering system that predicts when customers need to replenish products based on purchase frequency, household size, consumption patterns, and lifestyle preferences (e.g., budget-conscious, healthy shopper, premium buyer). The system should generate intelligent suggested orders, which customers can approve, modify, or auto-purchase via an omni-channel experience (app, web, or in-store pickup).\nBreaking down the problem # At first in order for the product to be developed and shipped efficiently the correct development cycle must be chosen. For this I was thinking of choosing extreme programming as it aligns well with sensitive customer data and is also quite agile. Also it shall be an attempt to democratize this sector as most competitive products are only implemented internally for their customers and are very closed source.\nCreating Issues # To create the correct issues is to do brainstorming in a narrow manner. In greater detail the issues describe the user experience and provide guidelines for the user interface.\nAs a user I\nwant to see a basket with the products I order most commonly want to see suggestions of probable products I may need want to green light a recurring order with some basic necessities want to chat with an agent to add products to my basket for a specific recipe or a function want to set preferences like budget, calories etc. However it is also important to define an Administrator role to oversee the user-AI interaction. As an admin I\nneed to check for errors and prevent overflows need to track stagnant orders need to predict demand based on active orders modify supply chains based on price fluctuations while fulfilling customer needs. Getting more specific a UML Diagram can describe the interface and the interactions. In grater detail to properly make the product the Use Case and Sequence diagrams shall be constructed.\nsequenceDiagram actor User participant Web Application participant Backend System participant Database User-\u003e\u003eWeb Application: Logs in/Opens Grocery List Web Application-\u003e\u003eBackend System: Retrieves User's Common Items Backend System-\u003e\u003eDatabase: Queries Purchase History Database--\u003e\u003eBackend System: Returns Frequent Items Backend System--\u003e\u003eWeb Application: Displays Common Items in Basket User-\u003e\u003eWeb Application: Adjusts Quantities/Adds Items User-\u003e\u003eWeb Application: Requests Product Suggestions Web Application-\u003e\u003eBackend System: Requests Product Suggestions (based on history, preferences) Backend System-\u003e\u003eDatabase: Queries Product Catalog \u0026 User Data Database--\u003e\u003eBackend System: Returns Suggested Products Backend System--\u003e\u003eWeb Application: Displays Product Suggestions User-\u003e\u003eWeb Application: Adds Suggested Items to Basket User-\u003e\u003eWeb Application: Initiates Checkout Web Application-\u003e\u003eBackend System: Creates Order Backend System-\u003e\u003eDatabase: Updates Inventory \u0026 Creates Order Record Backend System--\u003e\u003eWeb Application: Displays Order Confirmation Web Application--\u003e\u003eUser: Order Confirmation What is something of a debate; if the Chatbot/Agent shall gain an Actor role in the aforementioned diagrams\u0026hellip;\n","date":"2025 April 3","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1743682591214-hello-ai/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"First Time Dipping my Toes into AI","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2025 April 3","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":" Parametric Study of a Microwave Absorber Based on Metamaterials # this post is a work in progress # In the fall semester of academic year 2024-2025 I decided took upon a project in order to design a microwave absorber based on metamaterials. In this post I will document the progress as I learn and develop the cell and the modeling in order to lay everything publicly available and also to short of understand better as I try and explain the process to this figurative rubber ducky that is my editor, not the one it has because vs code pets is not very feature rich at the moment. Finally I have opened a GitHub repository for the report that I\u0026rsquo;ll eventually submit to my university and for based upon I\u0026rsquo;ll be credited, it can be found here.\nSo at first I start by designing a basic layout in CST..\nfor this I\u0026rsquo;ll implement a three-layer structure:\nA dielectric Substrate w/ a metal Resonance Layer An Air Layer A Metal Copper Back-Plate At first I\u0026rsquo;ll place the substrate without the resonance layer: Later I\u0026rsquo;ll place the metal resonance layer as well but there are a number of possible candidates I think of trying to simulate whereas the vertical layout is pretty much fixed.\nWithout further\u0026rsquo; ado I\u0026rsquo;ll place the two other layers below Z=0, turn on the orthographic side view to remove shadows and voila: I think it really gives a sense of scale as the air layer truly shadows the other two.\nNow its time to add the ring that is of the same material and thickness as the backplate and lies on top of the dielectric substrate. Then I will move the substrate, air and backplate layers all below Z=0 just ti make is easier with designing the arrows. For this I make the assumption that both the arrow body and point are \\(\\alpha = 0.5mm\\) of width. In order to accurately place all the curve points that define the arrow some basic calculations shall be made. The two points of the arrow base lie exactly on the arc of the ring and are equidistant from curve y=x so the in order to find their cartesian coordinates the following system shall be solved.\nsyms x1 x2 eq1 = 2*(x1 - x2)^2 == .5^2; eq2 = sqrt(x2^2 + x1^2) == 2.7; sol = solve([eq1, eq2], [x1 x2]); disp([sol.x1 sol.x2]); $$ \\displaystyle \\begin{array}{l} \\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \\sigma_3 -\\frac{2916,\\sigma_1 }{1433} \u0026amp; -\\sigma_1 \\newline \\sigma_4 -\\frac{2916,\\sigma_2 }{1433} \u0026amp; -\\sigma_2 \\newline \\frac{2916,\\sigma_1 }{1433}-\\sigma_3 \u0026amp; \\sigma_1 \\newline \\frac{2916,\\sigma_2 }{1433}-\\sigma_4 \u0026amp; \\sigma_2 \\end{array}\\right)\\newline\\newline \\textrm{where}\\newline \\sigma_1 =\\sqrt{\\frac{729}{200}-\\frac{7,\\sqrt{59}}{80}}\\newline \\sigma_2 =\\sqrt{\\frac{7,\\sqrt{59}}{80}+\\frac{729}{200}}\\newline \\sigma_3 =\\frac{400,{{\\left(\\frac{729}{200}-\\frac{7,\\sqrt{59}}{80}\\right)}}^{3/2} }{1433}\\newline \\sigma_4 =\\frac{400,{{\\left(\\frac{7,\\sqrt{59}}{80}+\\frac{729}{200}\\right)}}^{3/2} }{1433}\\end{array} $$\nWhich results in two points/quadrant so picking out the two points of the 1st quadrant and inserting them to CST the arrow body is parallel again Then the arrow is mirrored against the X, the Y and the XY planes in order to reach all four sides of the cell, then the face is covered with copper and a height of d=0.035mm is also attributed, which is why it was important to move all other layers below Z=0. Now I\u0026rsquo;ll try and perform a simulation using the frequency solver in CST just to get an idea how the component behaves, the boundaries will be periodic along the XY plate and I will add absorbing conditions along the Z axis.\nFor reference the mesh with only the ring element on the surface ends up such as: Adding the arrows and running the simulation mesh output looks something like: ","date":"2024 November 15","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/mmas/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"MMAs","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2023 November 21","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2023 November 20","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Homepage","summary":"","title":"Homepage","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
