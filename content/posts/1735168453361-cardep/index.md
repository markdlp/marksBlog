## My views on car dependency

I think I should start this article by saying that cars are not the problem car dependency is so there's a few ways to go about this but I will just provide the general overview about what I demand for myself as a citizen what I believe to be the correct way to build cities to build cities that serve humans to build cities that are efficient that I that are net positive and also showcase what's the wrong way to go about it what is the way it can be done inefficiently and having everyone afraid to change things. It's something you start notice and the moment you start noticing from then on it's it's something you can really not unnotice it stays persists in the view of any seasons perspective of their Urban environment so I should start by saying but every time you wait in the bus stop every time you have to go from a to b every time more or less you go outside the house there's one thing you can really not miss and that is cars now in certain Urban environment cars shouldn't and don't have to be necessary cars should be used to serve the sole purpose of what public transit cannot accomplish I know this because public transit is the efficient way to move people around I want to go out for parting and not have to drive afterwards I want to go out for drinks and be able to actually drink because I don't have to drive afterwards because I will just commute by train or by tram or by bus and I will be listening to my music or reading a book and not be strapped in a metal box. I'm of course rambling here but I will establish this point a little more and moving forward with this I will say that every time someone goes outside must really take a notice and see all the cars that are moving how many people are they carrying inside well the answer is one to two people and it sucks because these things take so much space huh the problem is cars are useful and we need them but we shouldn't always have to go for that option it's not a tool that we should over deploy and we have totally over deployed it.

But let me get started by explaining what I see fundamentally wrong with the urban sprawl. In other words how the long spread of single family housing corrupts a society.
So human societies in order to flourish need to have a few appliances. For instance a place ... In fact a place and more so a sense of it! Societies in order to evolve organically need to be centered around a location, maybe a port or a river valley or generally any _place_ where certain conditions meet. Big city hubs are connected with long edges that enable transportation, business and travel. Humans need to live in a net positive place not purely for economics but also for collective intellectual stimulation and that's something we can thank evolution for. What people need is to contribute to society easily to benefit and expand, to walk to the libraries and socialize in the common areas. To walk in alone and leave with some company they met while studying for the same class the exchange ideas; to embrace what sacred for a society is!
