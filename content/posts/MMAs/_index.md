### Parametric Study of a Microwave Absorber Based on Metamaterials.

_this post is pushed directly without preview as my windows pc cant handle docker 
along w/ every other program I ran for this all at once_

In the fall semester of academic year 2024-2025 I decided took upon a project in order to
design a microwave absorber based on metamaterials. In this post I will document the
progress as I learn and develop the cell and the modeling in order to lay everything
publicly available and also to short of understand better as I try and explain the process
to this figurative rubber ducky that _is_ my editor, not the one it _has_ because vs code 
pets is not very feature rich at the moment. Finally I have opened a GitHub repository
for the report that I'll eventually submit to my university and for based upon I'll be 
credited, it can be found [here](https://github.com/markdlp/ParametricStudy_MicrowaveAbsorberBasedOnMetamaterials).
