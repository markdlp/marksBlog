Okay so this post will be about how much I hate the Piraeus Harbour, why is it dysfunctional 
and why it is car infested. Why everyone puts the blame on personal responsibility while in
reality it is obvious that the infrastructure should improve to be more human centric and
fool resilient - foolproof.
