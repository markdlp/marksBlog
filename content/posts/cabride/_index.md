## middle August taxi night ride

So casual conversation here and I find myself out with some friends like I stayed at home the entire day and as I must admit I'm somewhat of an outgoing (23M) to individual only to eventually go out for some fresh air, which turned into a pass by a techno place and then went to find some friends while busting a joint and smashing a  couple of beers üçª and having a medium sized convo as I tried to catch the bus in the middle of the night (namely 3am).. that failed miserably which then resulted me in getting a cab for my way home... And this my friends is where my story begins...

I hop into the cab and immediately I realized that I wasn't in on the taxi I had ordered from FreeNow but spontaneously decided to roll with it!
I immediately cancelled FreeNow in an effort that 3 minutes were still within the margin of time..
We hit off and a couple of traffic lights later we stopped and a gentleman approached near the drivers window and asked a non clear question... but he did say something entitled to some interest!! 
That would be "airport".. I immediately asked in my perfect English "you wanna go to the airport?".. and right as I was about to tell him the number for radio taxi the driver stupidity said: "hey just take your baggage at the opposite side of the road, they were a (presumably French) couple of which the female individual - I believe - wants to go to the airport to catch a flight üõ´. Anyway he lures them into the perception that he was bow to pick them up from the opposite side. Then immediately he cranked up the speed and told me to try to justify that he wasn't in a position that would allow him to accommodate/service them and then immediately I jumped it in on the opportunity and ask him if I could light up cigarette inside the cab he says sure guy light it up and then immediately I pulled out my toe back okay I rolled up and leave it up as fast as I could manage it was regretful but it was an experience and I had to roll with it because it didn't really and not in any account had any control over the situation that was unfolding parallel to me so I just have to suck it up go on my ride to pay up and feel like a freaking caveman and that's what I would like to conclude on we humans we individuals with deserve more than car dependency we deserve more for our mental health we should be in a position to be responsible pay our taxes and utilize and enjoy human-centric cities and be grateful every time we enter a trap and see all the different aspects of life if I may or different versions of life if you will and kind of enjoy ourselves into admiring and emerging ourselves with individuals and a society as a whole look values citizen and politic moral values well that I will have to continue but for now it's been nice.
