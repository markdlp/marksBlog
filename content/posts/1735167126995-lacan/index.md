In this post I'm am attempting to understand Jacques Lacan, an endeavour
most likely doomed to fail as I ought to understand an enormous amount of
material and philosophy that precedes 'objet petit a'.

So I will start with the Borromean knot and as I try to understand it I will make parallels
with prior basic philosophy knowledge I happen to have accumulated.

So I try and see the Borromean knot as a Venn diagram which is of course not :knot: but it may
be a handy visualization to explain why objet petit a is placed in it's center.

So if the :knot: is a recipe, we shall gather the three registers first:

- Imaginary
- Symbolic
- Real

The reason the Borromean knot is indeed a :knot: is because the system cannot be sustained
should one of the three ingredients disappear. 

And then the intersections do not describe subjects but rather the connections between the two.
In other words
