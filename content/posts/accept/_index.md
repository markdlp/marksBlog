To accept someone is to love them for who they are, not for what I desire them to be.

_This post is an attempt to state what I have co e to believe after therapy and growing up in my household_

I was sixteen years of age when I started to realize that my close friends are far rom perfect.
By that time it was already clear that I was far from perfect as well but that is not to say
I'm superiority complex free

The complicated fact of the matter is that I started to think if I were to meet myself today, most
probably I wouldn't like me very much... which eventually let me to realize that I wouldn't like
quite a few people if I were to meet them today. But what does it mean to like to someone, well
it means to accept them for who they are talking into account all their defects and merits.

That being said I find myself frustrated quite often with the way people close to me think,
the way they attribute responsibility, and that they all want to brain drain their country so sure they
are she a lost game. But I shouldn't digress; what I'm trying to state here is that what is
key in befriending someone is how fast I can recognize their defects, in other words I souldn't
put blame on a friend for being irresponsible or for having their defects present to me because
I have accepted them for who they are.

In other words one may choose to not befriend, to assign blame, to dispute other's beliefs if
they do be realizing said other's defects before accepting them and it's all about that.

There are of course times when I have chosen to accompany someone having made the conscious decision
I cannot accept to bare their disadvantages and for that I guess I'm irresponsible myself.

They point I am making in this post is that if I recognize a defect of someone before we
become close then I am ethically allowed to not pursue a closer contact as I don't accept them.
However I am not to cut ties with someone I have befriended just because I struggle to understand
their defects and all their disadvantages that are so obvious to me... and that is because I made
the choice to befriend them _before_ these disadvantages were obvious to me.

I'd like to close with something irrelevant and that is I am ethically allowed to cut ties with a friend
who has chosen to cut ties with me first. In other words I shall stop caring about a former friend who
doesn't think of me as a friend any more
