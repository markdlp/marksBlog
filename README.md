My Blog Site

This repository hosts the source files for my site. It is built using Hugo for the generation of the static files and the blowfish theme. The site is served by GitHub pages and the domain is proxies through cloudflare.

In this repository one can find the drafts that're not included in the static files. A GitHub actions workflow is used to publish the content of the public directory to GitHub pages.

The main purpose of this site is to publish blogs I write regarding topics most people don't find interesting and thus I find it difficult to express, to discuss, to understand further.

It is of course made with:
- ♥️
- ☕
