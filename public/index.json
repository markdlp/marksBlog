In greater detail customers in the retail food industry often struggle with reordering essentials efficiently, leading to missed purchases, stockouts at home, and irrelevant product recommendations. While subscription models exist, they lack true personalization‚Äîfailing to consider individual shopping frequency, lifestyle preferences (health-conscious, budget-focused, premium), and real-time consumption patterns. In other words there is a need to Develop an AI-driven smart reordering system that predicts when customers need to replenish products based on purchase frequency, household size, consumption patterns, and lifestyle preferences (e.g., budget-conscious, healthy shopper, premium buyer). The system should generate intelligent suggested orders, which customers can approve, modify, or auto-purchase via an omni-channel experience (app, web, or in-store pickup).\nBreaking down the problem # At first in order for the product to be developed and shipped efficiently the correct development cycle must be chosen. For this I was thinking of choosing extreme programming as it aligns well with sensitive customer data and is also quite agile. Also it shall be an attempt to democratize this sector as most competitive products are only implemented internally for their customers and are very closed source.\nCreating Issues # To create the correct issues is to do brainstorming in a narrow manner. In greater detail the issues describe the user experience and provide guidelines for the user interface.\nAs a user I\nwant to see a basket with the products I order most commonly want to see suggestions of probable products I may need want to green light a recurring order with some basic necessities want to chat with an agent to add products to my basket for a specific recipe or a function want to set preferences like budget, calories etc. However it is also important to define an Administrator role to oversee the user-AI interaction. As an admin I\nneed to check for errors and prevent overflows need to track stagnant orders need to predict demand based on active orders modify supply chains based on price fluctuations while fulfilling customer needs. Getting more specific a UML Diagram can describe the interface and the interactions. sequenceDiagram Alice-\u003e\u003eJohn: Hello John, how are you? John--\u003e\u003eAlice: Great!

In this post I document the progress as per the development of the cell and the modeling in order to lay everything publicly available and understand better as I try explaining the process to this figurative rubber \u0026#x1f986; that is my editor. Finally I have opened a GitHub repository for the report that will eventually be submitted to my university and based upon I\u0026rsquo;ll be eventually credited; it can be found here.\nAbstract # Microwave absorbers play a crucial role in modern telecommunications and electronic systems by mitigating unwanted electromagnetic interference (EMI) and enhancing the performance of various devices. These absorbers are essential in applications ranging from radar systems and anechoic chambers to consumer electronics and medical devices. Traditional microwave absorbers, while effective, often suffer from limitations such as bulkiness and narrow bandwidth. Metamaterial-based microwave absorbers offer a promising alternative due to their unique electromagnetic properties, which are not found in natural materials. These engineered materials can achieve near-unity absorption across a wide range of frequencies, making them highly efficient. The advantages of metamaterial absorbers include their thin profile, lightweight nature, and the ability to tailor their absorption characteristics through precise structural design. This makes them ideal for applications requiring compact and efficient EMI mitigation. Additionally, metamaterial absorbers can be designed to operate over multiple frequency bands, providing versatility and enhanced performance in complex electromagnetic environments.\nIntroduction # Metamaterials are artificially designed materials that exhibit peculiar properties like negative refractive index, Snell\u0026rsquo;s law reversal, Doppler effect reverse, and left-handed behavior. These properties make them suitable for various applications, including perfect absorption. Metamaterial absorbers can achieve near-unity absorption, thin profiles, lightweight characteristics, and design flexibility.\nThe development of metamaterial absorbers has seen significant progress, with researchers exploring various designs and materials to enhance their performance. Metamaterial absorbers are predominantly used in the microwave, terahertz, and optical frequency spectra. Recent advancements include the development of multi-band polarization-insensitive metamaterial absorbers for microwave applications, broadband microwave coding metamaterial absorbers, and ultra-wideband origami microwave absorbers.\nThis study begins with a theoretical exploration of absorber devices and the unique properties of metamaterials that make them suitable for electromagnetic wave absorption. Following this, the report details the implementation of a specific microwave absorber device using advanced simulation software, highlighting the practical aspects of device design and performance evaluation. Finally, the report addresses the parametric design and optimization of the device, fine-tuning structural parameters to achieve optimal absorption characteristics. Through this comprehensive approach, the report aims to provide a thorough understanding of the principles, design methodologies, and practical applications of metamaterial-based microwave absorbers.\nTheoretical Study # Metamaterials are artificially engineered materials with unique electromagnetic properties not found in nature. They are designed with specific geometrical structures that allow them to exhibit properties like negative refractive index, reverse Snell\u0026rsquo;s law, and right/left-handed behavior. The first to coin the term of metamaterial absorbers was Victor Veselago.\nAn MMA typically comprises three layers:\nA periodic metallic pattern on top A dielectric substrate in the middle A bottom metallic ground plane As multi-layer structures in MMAs enable broadband absorption by creating multiple resonant frequencies. By stacking different layers with varying properties, a wider range of frequencies can be absorbed effectively.\nImpedance matching is crucial for MMAs to minimize reflection and maximize absorption. This is achieved when the impedance of the MMA is matched to the impedance of free space, ensuring that incident electromagnetic waves are absorbed rather than reflected.\nIn order to evaluate the absorption of the microwave metamaterial absorber proposed in this study the reflection and transmission power shall be calculated as well as the reflection coefficient. The bare necessary equations are shown in.\n$$ Z = Z_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_r}{\\epsilon_r}} \\newline \\newline \\Gamma = \\frac{Z - Z_0}{Z + Z_0} T = \\frac{2Z_0}{Z + Z_0} A = 1 - |\\Gamma|^2 - |T|^2 $$\n*The metal resonance layer is technically an extra layer on top of the substrate and as a matter of fact it\u0026rsquo;s the only layer above Z=0 for reasons that\u0026rsquo;ll become obvious later on.\nAt first placing the substrate without the resonance layer, then I\u0026rsquo;ll place the two other layers, turn on the orthographic side view to remove shadows and voila: I think it really gives a sense of scale as the air layer truly dwarfs the others.\nNow its time to add the ring that is of the same material and thickness as the backplate and lies on top of the dielectric substrate. For the arrows I make the assumption that both the arrow body and point are \\(\\alpha = 0.5mm\\) of width. In order to accurately place all the curve points that define the arrow some basic calculations shall be made. The two points of the arrow base lay exactly on the arc of the ring (w/ r=2.7mm) and are equidistant from curve y=x so the in order to find their cartesian coordinates the following system shall be solved.\nsyms x1 x2 eq1 = 2*(x1 - x2)^2 == .5^2; eq2 = sqrt(x2^2 + x1^2) == 2.7; sol = solve([eq1, eq2], [x1 x2]); disp([sol.x1 sol.x2]); $$ \\displaystyle \\begin{array}{l} \\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \\sigma_3 -\\frac{2916,\\sigma_1 }{1433} \u0026amp; -\\sigma_1 \\newline \\sigma_4 -\\frac{2916,\\sigma_2 }{1433} \u0026amp; -\\sigma_2 \\newline \\frac{2916,\\sigma_1 }{1433}-\\sigma_3 \u0026amp; \\sigma_1 \\newline \\frac{2916,\\sigma_2 }{1433}-\\sigma_4 \u0026amp; \\sigma_2 \\end{array}\\right)\\newline\\newline \\textrm{where}\\newline \\sigma_1 =\\sqrt{\\frac{729}{200}-\\frac{7,\\sqrt{59}}{80}}\\newline \\sigma_2 =\\sqrt{\\frac{7,\\sqrt{59}}{80}+\\frac{729}{200}}\\newline \\sigma_3 =\\frac{400,{{\\left(\\frac{729}{200}-\\frac{7,\\sqrt{59}}{80}\\right)}}^{3/2} }{1433}\\newline \\sigma_4 =\\frac{400,{{\\left(\\frac{7,\\sqrt{59}}{80}+\\frac{729}{200}\\right)}}^{3/2} }{1433}\\end{array} $$\nWhich results in two points per quadrant, picking out the two points of the 1st quadrant and inserting them to CST the arrow body is parallel again Then the arrow is mirrored against the X, the Y and the XY planes in order to reach all four sides of the cell, then the face is covered with copper and a height of d=0.035mm is also attributed, which is why it was important to place all other layers below Z=0.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;ll try and perform a simulation using the frequency solver in CST from 2.7 to 12.7 GHz, adding a port with space (\\(Z_{max}\\)) in front of the cell and setting the orientation to negative so that is faces the absorber and the coordinates as full-plane the boundaries will be periodic along the XY plate and I will add an absorbing condition (\\(Z_{min}\\)).\nThe mesh of after of the structure after the simulation is as: For the Electrical Field Simulation \u0026gt; and for the frequency [2.7, 7.7, 12.7] GHz and for \\(Z_{max}(1)\\) is as:\nFor the Electric Field Simulation \u0026gt; and for the frequency [2.7, 7.7, 12.7] GHz and for \\(Z_{max}(2)\\) is as:\nTaking a look in the \\(S_{11}\\) of \\(Z_{max}\\) that represents the reflection coefficient as well as the \\(S_{21}\\) that represents the port coupling, after the simulation as\u0026hellip; The Absorptivity (against the frequency) is an essential metric and CST calculates it as shown in \u0026hellip;. For the evaluation of the absorber Absorptivity can be calculated using the Fresnel equation: \\( A = 1 - R - T \\), where T is the transmission coefficient \u0026hellip; and can be calculated using the Fresnel equation: \\(T = \\frac{2Z_0} {Z+Z_0}\\) and R is the reflection coefficient (\\(\\Gamma\\)) and can be calculated from the formula: \\(R = \\frac{Z - Z_0}{Z + Z_0}\\). However the Z mentioned needs to be the normalized impedance of the absorber so this is where the calculation will start.\n","date":"2024 December 25","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/1735168050337-mma/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Parametric Study of a Microwave Absorber Based on Metamaterials","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2024 December 25","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/philosophy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Philosophy","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024 December 25","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/psychology/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Psychology","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024 December 25","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tag/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tag","type":"tags"},{"content":"Okay so this post will be about how much I hate the Piraeus Harbour, why is it dysfunctional and why it is car infested.
