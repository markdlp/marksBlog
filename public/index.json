By that time it was already clear that I was far from perfect as well but that is not to say I\u0026rsquo;m superiority complex free\nThe complicated fact of the matter is that I started to think if I were to meet myself today, most probably I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t like me very much\u0026hellip; which eventually let me to realize that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t like quite a few people if I were to meet them today. But what does it mean to like to someone, well it means to accept them for who they are talking into account all their defects and merits.\nThat being said I find myself frustrated quite often with the way people close to me think, the way they attribute responsibility, and that they all want to brain drain their country so sure they are she a lost game. But I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t digress; what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to state here is that what is key in befriending someone is how fast I can recognize their defects, in other words I souldn\u0026rsquo;t put blame on a friend for being irresponsible or for having their defects present to me because I have accepted them for who they are.\nIn other words one may choose to not befriend, to assign blame, to dispute other\u0026rsquo;s beliefs if they do be realizing said other\u0026rsquo;s defects before accepting them and it\u0026rsquo;s all about that.\nThere are of course times when I have chosen to accompany someone having made the conscious decision I cannot accept to bare their disadvantages and for that I guess I\u0026rsquo;m irresponsible myself.\nThey point I am making in this post is that if I recognize a defect of someone before we become close then I am ethically allowed to not pursue a closer contact as I don\u0026rsquo;t accept them. However I am not to cut ties with someone I have befriended just because I struggle to understand their defects and all their disadvantages that are so obvious to me\u0026hellip; and that is because I made the choice to befriend them before these disadvantages were obvious to me.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to close with something irrelevant and that is I am ethically allowed to cut ties with a friend who has chosen to cut ties with me first. In other words I shall stop caring about a former friend who doesn\u0026rsquo;t think of me as a friend any more\n","date":"2024 November 24","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/accept/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Accept","type":"posts"},{"content":" Parametric Study of a Microwave Absorber Based on Metamaterials # this post is a work in progress # In the fall semester of academic year 2024-2025 I decided took upon a project in order to design a microwave absorber based on metamaterials. In this post I document the progress as per the development of the cell and the modeling in order to lay everything publicly available and understand better as I try explaining the process to this figurative rubber \u0026#x1f986; that is my editor. Finally I have opened a GitHub repository for the report that will eventually be submitted to my university and based upon I\u0026rsquo;ll be eventually credited; it can be found here.\nSo to start by designing a basic layout in CST I\u0026rsquo;ll implement a three-layer structure:\nA dielectric Substrate w/ a metal Resonance Layer* An Air Layer A Metal Copper Back-Plate *The metal resonance layer is technically an extra layer on top of the substrate and as a matter of fact it\u0026rsquo;s the only layer above Z=0 for reasons that\u0026rsquo;ll become obvious later on.\nAt first placing the substrate without the resonance layer, then I\u0026rsquo;ll place the two other layers, turn on the orthographic side view to remove shadows and voila: I think it really gives a sense of scale as the air layer truly dwarfs the others.\nNow its time to add the ring that is of the same material and thickness as the backplate and lies on top of the dielectric substrate. For the arrows I make the assumption that both the arrow body and point are \\(\\alpha = 0.5mm\\) of width. In order to accurately place all the curve points that define the arrow some basic calculations shall be made. The two points of the arrow base lay exactly on the arc of the ring (w/ r=2.7mm) and are equidistant from curve y=x so the in order to find their cartesian coordinates the following system shall be solved.\nsyms x1 x2 eq1 = 2*(x1 - x2)^2 == .5^2; eq2 = sqrt(x2^2 + x1^2) == 2.7; sol = solve([eq1, eq2], [x1 x2]); disp([sol.x1 sol.x2]); $$ \\displaystyle \\begin{array}{l} \\left(\\begin{array}{cc} \\sigma_3 -\\frac{2916,\\sigma_1 }{1433} \u0026amp; -\\sigma_1 \\newline \\sigma_4 -\\frac{2916,\\sigma_2 }{1433} \u0026amp; -\\sigma_2 \\newline \\frac{2916,\\sigma_1 }{1433}-\\sigma_3 \u0026amp; \\sigma_1 \\newline \\frac{2916,\\sigma_2 }{1433}-\\sigma_4 \u0026amp; \\sigma_2 \\end{array}\\right)\\newline\\newline \\textrm{where}\\newline \\sigma_1 =\\sqrt{\\frac{729}{200}-\\frac{7,\\sqrt{59}}{80}}\\newline \\sigma_2 =\\sqrt{\\frac{7,\\sqrt{59}}{80}+\\frac{729}{200}}\\newline \\sigma_3 =\\frac{400,{{\\left(\\frac{729}{200}-\\frac{7,\\sqrt{59}}{80}\\right)}}^{3/2} }{1433}\\newline \\sigma_4 =\\frac{400,{{\\left(\\frac{7,\\sqrt{59}}{80}+\\frac{729}{200}\\right)}}^{3/2} }{1433}\\end{array} $$\nWhich results in two points per quadrant, picking out the two points of the 1st quadrant and inserting them to CST the arrow body is parallel again Then the arrow is mirrored against the X, the Y and the XY planes in order to reach all four sides of the cell, then the face is covered with copper and a height of d=0.035mm is also attributed, which is why it was important to move all other layers below Z=0.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;ll try and perform a simulation using the frequency solver in CST from 2.7 to 12.7 GHz, adding a port with space (\\(Z_{max}\\)) in front of the cell and setting the orientation to negative so that is faces the absorber and the coordinates as full-plane the boundaries will be periodic along the XY plate and I will add an absorbing condition (\\(Z_{min}\\)).\nThe mesh of after of the structure after the simulation is as: For the Electrical Field Simulation \u0026gt; and for the frequency [2.7, 7.7, 12.7] GHz and for \\(Z_{max}(1)\\) is as:\n","date":"2024 November 15","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/mmas/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"MMAs","type":"posts"},{"content":"Okay so this post will be about how much I hate the Piraeus Harbour, why is it dysfunctional and why it is car infested.

I immediately cancelled FreeNow in an effort that 3 minutes were still within the margin of time.. We hit off and a couple of traffic lights later we stopped and a gentleman approached near the drivers window and asked a non clear question\u0026hellip; but he did say something entitled to some interest!! That would be \u0026ldquo;airport\u0026rdquo;.. I immediately asked in my perfect English \u0026ldquo;you wanna go to the airport?\u0026rdquo;.. and right as I was about to tell him the number for radio taxi the driver stupidity said: \u0026ldquo;hey just take your baggage at the opposite side of the road, they were a (presumably French) couple of which the female individual - I believe - wants to go to the airport to catch a flight üõ´. Anyway he lures them into the perception that he was bow to pick them up from the opposite side. Then immediately he cranked up the speed and told me to try to justify that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t in a position that would allow him to accommodate/service them and then immediately I jumped it in on the opportunity and ask him if I could light up cigarette inside the cab he says sure guy light it up and then immediately I pulled out my toe back okay I rolled up and leave it up as fast as I could manage it was regretful but it was an experience and I had to roll with it because it didn\u0026rsquo;t really and not in any account had any control over the situation that was unfolding parallel to me so I just have to suck it up go on my ride to pay up and feel like a freaking caveman and that\u0026rsquo;s what I would like to conclude on we humans we individuals with deserve more than car dependency we deserve more for our mental health we should be in a position to be responsible pay our taxes and utilize and enjoy human-centric cities and be grateful every time we enter a trap and see all the different aspects of life if I may or different versions of life if you will and kind of enjoy ourselves into admiring and emerging ourselves with individuals and a society as a whole look values citizen and politic moral values well that I will have to continue but for now it\u0026rsquo;s been nice.\n","date":"2023 November 21","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/cabride/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Cabride","type":"posts"},{"content":"~ In this post I will make an attempt to summerize all if not ost of my ideas and views regarding the attitude that cars induce into sosieties and individuals. ~\nIf I am to suck it up and comply with all the stupid and irrational assaults thrown to me I would defenately find myself in a state of\u0026hellip; What offends me the most is listening to potato arguments.
